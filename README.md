Olympics Data Analysis Project
Overview
This Python-based data analysis project explores the Olympic Games dataset, focusing on gender integration and athlete success patterns. While the project was completed as part of the G-Academy course curriculum, all code and analysis in this repository represent my individual work.
Important Note
Code Ownership: All code,in this repository are my original work. While the project concept was part of a group assignment at G-Academy, the code implementation and analysis are entirely my own.

Project Goals:

1)Women's Integration Analysis

Examining the historical progression of women's participation in the Olympics
Analyzing gender distribution across different sports and events
Tracking medal achievements by gender


2)Winning Profile Analysis

Identifying key characteristics of successful Olympic athletes
Analyzing performance patterns across sports
Investigating factors contributing to Olympic success



Methodology Note
As per course instructions, the analysis treats each sport as a single category, without differentiating between subcategories or disciplines within sports. This approach ensures consistency across the analysis and aligns with the project requirements.
